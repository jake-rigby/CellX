The software was commissioned by [Dr. Gina Galli](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/gina.galli/) and is ongoing in development.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nDownload and run the latest [.exe] (https://github.com/jake-rigby/CellX/releases) \r\n\r\n##Use\r\n\r\n-Upscale and convert videos to .FLV format (required) with File > Convert Video\r\n\r\n-Load converted videos with File > Load Video\r\n\r\n-Browse loaded videos and use the scrub controls to isolate frames of interest\r\n\r\n-Grab frames and perform arbitrary measurements on them in the editor\r\n\r\n-Mark one of your frames as a calibration frame\r\n\r\n-Save the session of frames, or export a CSV of results\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

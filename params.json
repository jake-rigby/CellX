{"name":"CellX","tagline":"Cell measurement tool","body":"CellX\r\n=====\r\n\r\nA lightweight video analysis tool to measure arbitrarily wiggly cells.\r\n\r\nThis project came out of the need to comparatively measure the length of cardiac cells during successive resting and stimulated action potentials. The software was commissioned by [Dr. Gina Galli](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/gina.galli/) and is ongoing in development.\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n\r\nDownload and run the latest [.exe] (https://github.com/jake-rigby/CellX/releases) \r\n\r\n###Use\r\n\r\n- Upscale and convert videos to .FLV format (required) with File > Convert Video\r\n\r\n- Load converted videos with File > Load Video\r\n\r\n- Browse loaded videos and use the scrub controls to isolate frames of interest\r\n\r\n- Grab frames and perform arbitrary measurements on them in the editor\r\n\r\n- Mark one of your frames as a calibration frame\r\n\r\n- Save the session of frames, or export a CSV of results\r\n\r\n###Notes\r\n\r\n- Videos must be converted to .FLV format - a distribution of [ffmpeg] (http://www.ffmpeg.org/) is included as a native process to achieve this conversion. The on-board conversion will maximise i-frame insertion at 25fps (which will make the video file-size very large), so it is advisable to only keep copies of your source videos, and keep conversions in a temp file, as the source files are not affected by the conversion. Future versions will up-scale i-frames on the fly and only cache required frames, removing the need for explicit conversion.\r\n\r\n- Many thanks to [Dr. Gina Galli](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/gina.galli/) for the oportunity to help with her experiments.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
